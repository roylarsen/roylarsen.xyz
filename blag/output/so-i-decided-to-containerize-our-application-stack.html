<p>This is going to be the first part of a series of posts where I'm going to document my journey containerizing our Platform.</p>
</p>
<p>Here's the story so far:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.roylarsen.xyz/so-i-decided-to-containerize-our-application-stack-pt-2/">Part 2</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2 id="firstforays">First Forays</h2>
</p>
<p>The beginning of this journey was extremely haphazard (aka, I was bored one night and wanted something to work on while watching TV). For fun I spun up a Server 2016 box with our software installed on it and set up <a href="https://www.roylarsen.xyz/docker-on-windows/">Docker on Windows</a> since (due to our Customers) our Platform is Windows first.</p>
</p>
<p>Once that was all done, I copied the .wars that make up our admin application and the distribution of tomcat that we use and threw all of that into a Dockerfile and spun it up to talk to the SQL Server instance installed on that box.</p>
</p>
<p>It was pretty cool to type <code>docker run</code> and connect to that tomcat instance and see it work. <a href="https://gist.github.com/roylarsen/14f0f87775e4d039e47d2c42002d0d87">Server 2016 Dockerfile</a></p>
</p>
<p>It's all fun to get this to work on Windows, but lets face it, Windows is a limiting factor when all the new developments in DevOps treats Windows as a Second Class Citizen at best.</p>
</p>
<h2 id="movingforward">Moving Forward</h2>
</p>
<p>Those first steps were done back in November of 2018 and I eventually picked this back up in May of 2019.</p>
</p>
<p>This is when I started to want to get more serious about my personal projects and wanting to learn more about containers and take learning Docker more seriously.</p>
</p>
<h3 id="deployingourwarstolinux">Deploying our wars to linux</h3>
</p>
<p>This is where things get really fun.</p>
</p>
<p>With the help of my awesome co-worker Valerie answering my really basic questions, I got things working.</p>
</p>
<p>The nice thing about Java is the WORA (write once, run anywhere) principal it follows. For the most part the initial getting things working was a case of pulling the image for Tomcat 8.5.40 and building my container by writing another pretty basic Dockerfile. <a href="https://gist.github.com/roylarsen/6c9bb232120e04ef913d20cae01e52a4">Linux Dockerfile</a></p>
</p>
<p>After some trial and error and tracking down dependencies (jar with the SQL Server driver, a mail library) to get things working, I got a connection to an existing database on another server, and authentication via LDAP that was already pre-configured in that database.</p>
</p>
<p>Getting our webapps to work on Linux has been fun, because I'm getting to learn more about Tomcat. For the most part, the server.xml is a static entity but there are items that I want to be able to pass to the container as it starts up. Mainly the DB connection string and information.</p>
</p>
<p>That's where I learned how to use the \$JAVA_OPTS to populate variables in the server.xml.</p>
</p>
<p><code>docker run -it -p 80:8080 -e "JAVA_OPTS=$JAVA_OPTS -Ddbserver=sql1" --net test mhb/heartbeat:1.0</code></p>
</p>
<p>Is what I've been using to launch the tomcat container with the environment variable to set the JAVA_OPTS environment variable in the container.</p>
</p>
<p>With <code>-e "JAVA_OPTS=$JAVA_OPTS -Ddbserver=sql1"</code> option, that sets the \$JAVA_OPTS environment variable in the container. Within the server.xml I have access to the dbserver variable that I can set with \${dbserver}.</p>
</p>
<p>The next iteration of this is going to involve learning the setenv.sh script so I can use environment files in my compose file so I can more securly set the variables.</p>
</p>
<h3 id="comingupwithatasklist">Coming up with a task list</h3>
</p>
<p>Once I saw that working, I came up with a list of tasks to go from the most basic of POC to an actual MVP that I can show off and see what people think.</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Get <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker?view=sql-server-2017&amp;pivots=cs1-bash">SQL Server on Linux working in Docker</a></li>
<li>Figure out how to run our <a href="https://flywaydb.org/">Flyway</a> migrations in Docker</li>
<li>Wire everything up in docker</li>
<li>Perform builds and deploy to Docker</li>
<li>Docker Compose</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Now I have a task list to work through</p>
</p>
