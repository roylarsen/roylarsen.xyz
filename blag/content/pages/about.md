Hey.

I'm not super great with writing about myself, it aways feels weird.

So, who am I?

---

### basics.

As of my writing of this, I'm 36 years old and living in the Greater Boston Area.

---

### professional.

I'm currently a DevOps Engineer with [Mobile Heartbeat](https://www.mobileheartbeat.com), formally Infrastucture Engineer at [Hachette Book Group](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com), formally formally IT Specialist III at the [State of Vermont](https://www.vermont.gov)

With Mobile Heartbeat, I'm currently working on building out the Terraform, configuring Kubernetes, and fighting with Azure to deploy our upcoming SaaS offering: [Banyan](https://www.mobileheartbeat.com/platform/banyan/)

These days, professionally, I'm most interested in the things happening in the DevOps/SRE space. I love Python, I'm getting into Docker more and more, and I want to get better at Golang.

---

### personal.

Outside of work, I'm an avid musician and tabletop gamer.

Currently music-wise, I'm in NOT MUCH doing NOT MUCH.

Past work I've done is here:  
[https://drugblood.bandcamp.com](https://drugblood.bandcamp.com)  
[https://doomservice.bandcamp.com/](https://doomservice.bandcamp.com/)  
There's other bands, but they're either ancient history or never did any recordings, or were purposefully scrubbed from the Internet
